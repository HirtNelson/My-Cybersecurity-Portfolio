# Nelson Hirt — Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository serves as my personal cybersecurity portfolio and knowledge base.  
It contains technical write-ups, notes, and documented methodologies derived from hands-on practice with CTF environments and security challenges.

The primary focus of this repository is not only exploitation, but **methodical reasoning, attack chaining, and clear technical documentation**.

Below is a collection of detailed walkthroughs for selected TryHackMe rooms.  
Each write-up documents the full attack lifecycle, including enumeration, exploitation, lateral movement, and privilege escalation.
