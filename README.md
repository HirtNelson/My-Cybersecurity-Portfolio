# Nelson Hirt — Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository serves as my personal cybersecurity portfolio and knowledge base.  
It contains technical write-ups, notes, and documented methodologies derived from hands-on practice with CTF environments and security challenges.

The primary focus of this repository is not only exploitation, but **methodical reasoning, attack chaining, and clear technical documentation**.

## TryHackMe Write-ups

Below is a collection of detailed walkthroughs for selected TryHackMe rooms.  
Each write-up documents the full attack lifecycle, including enumeration, exploitation, lateral movement, and privilege escalation.

- [Hammer](./THM-Writeups/Hammer/README.md)
- [Skynet](./THM-Writeups/Skynet/README.md)
- [Expose](./THM-Writeups/Expose/README.md)
- [ToolsRus](./THM-Writeups/ToolsRus/README.md)
- [Basic Pentesting](./THM-Writeups/Basic_Pentesting/README.md)
- [RootMe](./THM-Writeups/RootMe/README.md)
- [Billing](./THM-Writeups/Billing/README.md)
- [LazyAdmin](./THM-Writeups/LazyAdmin/README.md)
- [Brains](./THM-Writeups/Brains/README.md)
- [Pyrat](./THM-Writeups/Pyrat/README.md)
- [Second](./THM-Writeups/Second/README.md)

## Technical Focus

Throughout the write-ups, the following areas are consistently explored:

- Network and service enumeration
- Web application security testing
- Authentication and access control weaknesses
- Server-Side vulnerabilities (SQLi, SSTI, misconfigurations)
- Privilege escalation techniques
- Post-exploitation analysis
- Technical reporting and documentation

---

## Tools and Environment

The labs and write-ups primarily rely on standard offensive security tooling, including:

- Kali Linux
- Nmap
- Burp Suite
- Metasploit Framework
- Wireshark
- Custom scripts when automation is required

Tool usage is documented only when it adds technical value to the attack narrative.

---

## Objectives

- Develop a solid foundation in offensive security
- Practice real-world attack methodologies in controlled environments
- Improve technical reasoning and reporting skills
- Maintain a structured and evolving learning repository
