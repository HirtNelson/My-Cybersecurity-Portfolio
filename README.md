# 🛡️ Nelson Hirt | Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is my personal cybersecurity knowledge base, containing technical write-ups, notes, and documented methodologies used while solving CTF machines and security challenges.

This project reflects my hands-on learning process, focusing on **reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation**, and—most importantly—**clear technical documentation**.
